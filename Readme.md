# Automate Instagram Messages using Python


In this article, we will see how to send a single message to any number of people. We just have to provide a list of users. We will use selenium for this task.

## Packages Needed

- I have added a requrement file so that you can install all in once. To install this module run this command into your terminal.
  - Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## NOTE
Replace "Your Name/Username" with your actual name or username.

## Usage

- When you log in to Instagram you will come across two pop-up boxes as shown in the images. The first one will be asking about do you want to save info or not it will click on not now. The second one will be asking you to turn off the notifications or not so we will again click on not now as shown in the given code.

- Clicking on the message option on the right corner 

- Clicking on the pencil option here we type the userâ€™s name.
